                The concept and creation of autonomously operating machines dates back a long time, but credible research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. And today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as we continue to research, design and build new robots that serve various practical purposes including domestic, commercial and military.

                We firmly believe in working in a planned, organized and disciplined manner that helps us in risk free management. The proceedings of the clubs are all pre-planned and run smoothly according to the constitution. Well defined goals, an organized and disciplined work structure and motivated members are the features of the club, to mention a few, that have helped the club to grow to a level where we see it now. The club today is an active platform for students to display and develop their practical machine building skills and knowledge. Any company interested to adopt any of the Robotics devices, we would be more than happy to adopt or transfer the technology.
